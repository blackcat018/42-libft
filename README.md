42-libft
42 Libft Project â€“ A custom C library (libft.a) developed as part of the 1337/42 coding school curriculum.

Project Overview
This project aims to recreate essential functions from the C standard library (libc), while also implementing a set of additional utility functions and linked list operations. The final goal is to produce a static library, libft.a, which can be reused in various future projects.

Your custom implementations must behave identically to their libc counterparts, including edge cases and crashes. Proper error handling and adherence to function prototypes are crucial, as is avoiding memory leaks and segmentation faults.

How It Works
Static Library: The library will be compiled into libft.a, allowing for easy reuse in other projects.
Header File: All function prototypes, structs, and necessary inclusions are found in libft.h.
Makefile: This automates the compilation process, ensuring all functions are correctly compiled into the static library.
Libft Functions
Functions from <ctype.h>
ft_isalpha - Checks if a character is alphabetic.
ft_isdigit - Checks if a character is a digit.
ft_isalnum - Checks if a character is alphanumeric.
ft_isascii - Checks if a character belongs to the ASCII set.
ft_isprint - Checks if a character is printable.
ft_toupper - Converts a character to uppercase.
ft_tolower - Converts a character to lowercase.
Functions from <string.h>
ft_memset - Fills memory with a constant byte.
ft_strlen - Computes the length of a string.
ft_bzero - Zeros a byte string.
ft_memcpy - Copies memory area.
ft_memmove - Moves memory area.
ft_strlcpy - Copies string with size restrictions.
ft_strlcat - Concatenates strings with size restrictions.
ft_strchr - Locates character in a string.
ft_strrchr - Locates character in a string (from the end).
ft_strncmp - Compares two strings.
ft_memchr - Scans memory for a character.
ft_memcmp - Compares memory areas.
ft_strnstr - Locates a substring within a string.
ft_strdup - Duplicates a string.
Functions from <stdlib.h>
ft_atoi - Converts a string to an integer.
ft_calloc - Allocates and zeroes memory.
Additional Non-Standard Functions
ft_substr - Extracts a substring from a string.
ft_strjoin - Joins two strings.
ft_strtrim - Trims a string using a specific set of characters.
ft_split - Splits a string using a specified delimiter.
ft_itoa - Converts an integer to a string.
ft_strmapi - Applies a function to each character of a string.
ft_striteri - Iterates over a string and applies a function.
ft_putchar_fd - Writes a character to a file descriptor.
ft_putstr_fd - Writes a string to a file descriptor.
ft_putendl_fd - Writes a string to a file descriptor followed by a newline.
ft_putnbr_fd - Writes an integer to a file descriptor.
Linked List Functions
ft_lstnew - Creates a new list element.
ft_lstadd_front - Adds an element at the beginning of a list.
ft_lstsize - Counts the number of elements in a list.
ft_lstlast - Returns the last element of a list.
ft_lstadd_back - Adds an element at the end of a list.
ft_lstclear - Deletes and frees all elements of a list.
Compilation
To compile the library, run:

bash
Copy code
make
This will generate the libft.a static library, which can be linked into other projects.

Usage
To use libft.a in your own projects, simply include libft.h and link the library:

c
Copy code
#include "libft.h"
Then, when compiling, link with the library:

bash
Copy code
gcc your_program.c -L. -lft -o your_program
Conclusion
The Libft project provides a deeper understanding of C programming by developing commonly used functions from scratch. The project is an excellent stepping stone towards mastering low-level programming and building a solid foundation in algorithmic thinking.
ft_lstiter - applies a function to each element of a list.
ft_lstmap - applies a function to each element of a list.
